This project has Tailwind CSS v4 installed. Use Tailwind CSS classes instead of manual styling with class names and css when possible. When there are common styles to group, use `@apply`. For already existing files, convert existing styles to tailwind css only when necessary or asked explicitly by the user to do so.
If your knowledge cutoff is behind Tailwind CSS v4 and not familiar with it, refer to the docs(https://tailwindcss.com/docs) first. v3 and v4 might differ quite a bit.
